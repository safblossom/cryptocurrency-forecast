This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the Bitcoin (BTC/USD) exchange rate using two powerful time series models: **ARIMA** and **LSTM**.

---

## Project Overview

Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and difficult to predict. This project uses historical Bitcoin price data (2012-2024) to build and compare:

- **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) — a classical statistical model for time series forecasting.
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) — a deep learning model capable of capturing complex, non-linear patterns in sequential data.
